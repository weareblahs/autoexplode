# autoexplode
A shutdown tool powered by shutdown.exe on Windows computers using executable files

# The original project
I started this project on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoexplode/) back in 2018 and wanted to save it from the dead, so I remade AutoExplode from the ashes of Autoexplode (what did i just said). Original releases were in the "Releases" category.

TL;DR: it's in sourceforge, you know that
